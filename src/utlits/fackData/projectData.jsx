        description: "In 2024, I had the pleasure of branding ZIPPEX, a pioneering app based in Abbotsford, Canada, committed to transforming local delivery and fostering community connections. More than just a delivery service, ZIPPEX is a vibrant platform that champions local businesses and promotes sustainability through a unique peer-to-peer model. The logo features a distinctive \"X\" composed of four squares, symbolizing an open boxâ€”a nod to the app's mission of sharing goods and encouraging collaboration within neighborhoods. This design embodies the trust and camaraderie ZIPPEX cultivates, setting it apart from traditional delivery services. My work aimed to reflect this spirit of innovation and community, helping to build a more connected and thriving local landscape."
